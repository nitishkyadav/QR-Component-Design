## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While Designing QR Component, I got stuck to align QR Component in the center of the page. Tried a lot of things to bring the QR Component to the center of the screen. But in the end, it was resolved by inserting header tag at the top.

### Continued development

I will focus more on Responsive Design Part

I truly owe to [Virlus Jeanty](https://github.com/vjeanty02). It was only after playing around with his code, I was able to align the QR Component into the center of the screen by adding header to the Document.
